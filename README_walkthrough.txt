Pokemon API walkthrough - Windows 10

1. Create project directory. E.g., "pokemon-api"
2. Navigate to project directory. In Terminal, run "python -m venv env" 
	(without quotation marks, of course). This creates a virtual environment
	called "env". The name of the env does not matter, but I generally go with "env."
3. Activate virtual environment. In the directory, type "env\Scripts\activate" (where "env"
	is the name of your env).
4. In terminal with the env active, type "pip install flask". This will install flask.


python -m venv env
